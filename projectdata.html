        <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

        <p>Learning how to create and edit a table and how to develop a form in html were the two main learning outcomes from this assignment.</p>

        <p>Without explicitly specifying the method the form will work through the GET process, writing the attributes on the URL. This is not the most secure way but the information for this page is not sensitive.</p>
        
        <p>It was applied several different styles for the table and the form, such as padding, differnt background collor and borders as it can be seen on the page.</p>
